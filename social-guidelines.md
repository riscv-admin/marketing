# RISC-V Social Guidelines # 

This document covers the guidelines we use for posting on [RISC-V Twitter](https://twitter.com/risc_v) and [RISC-V LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/risc-v-international).

## Objectives ##
One of the top Visibility priorities continues to be strategic visibility through analysts, press, and media with strong and constant communications in major world-wide geographies. 

RISC-V social media is an important tool to help spread the word about RISC-V to our followers as well as extending beyond our current follower base and to the extended community. 

We strive to:
* Demonstrate industry thought leadership through original content and case studies
* Amplify member progress through RISC-V communications 
* Advance topics and conversations that educate and advance RISC-V
* Continue building positive affinity for RISC-V among key influencers and throughout the community
* Drive engagement and participation in RISC-V

To do this:
* Keep messages positive and uplifting.
* Communicate big picture ideas vs “announcements” or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
* Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
* Maintain a balance of posting on RISC-V activities/news and ecosystem-focused content.
* Share member, organizational, and community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused.
* Engage with the community through retweets, sharing, and original posting of community content.

## Engagement is important! ##
Engagement is the most important tool we have in our social tool bag! We want to retweet on Twitter and share on LinkedIn RISC-V content shared by the community to help bring broader awareness to those in the community that are talking about RISC-V.

Conversely, we want the community to re-share the content RISC-V posts to bring awareness to RISC-V outside the community that already knows us.

Let’s keep the RISC-V enthusiasm going!

## The type of content we will share: ## 
* Updates on the RISC-V project including public information from RISC-V SIGs and task groups.
* Stories about RISC-V use in end user environments
* RISC-V content in the key technical areas including 
  * Services: fabrication and design services
  * I/O: memory, network, and storage
  * Chip: SoC, IP, and FPGA
  * Software: development tools, firmware, operating systems
  * Security
* RISC-V in vertical industries
  * Cloud and Data Center
  * Automotive
  * HPC
  * Industrial IoT
  * Mobile and wireless
  * Consumer and IoT devices
* Technical how-to’s
* Editorials, news stories, insights, and perspectives that share information and show thought leadership
* Information on RISC-V events and upcoming events where RISC-V content is being presented

## Guidelines ##
* For all RISC-V social activity, we strive to remain neutral 
* Owned content such as news, blogs, and case studies are shared via RISC-V channels
* Members who join at Premier level get a stand-alone tweet from RISC-V Twitter.
* Premier level members get 2 social media spotlights per month.
* Strategic level members get 1 social media spotlight on per month.
* Member press releases will be shared via a retweet (Twitter) and a share (LinkedIn). It is preferred the RT and share comes from a person at the organization and not the corporate handle.
* Sharing of upcoming event information is limited to RISC-V events, events where there is RISC-V content and are posted on the RISC-V website, and Community events (meetups).
* Member events such as webinars may be re-shared on RISC-V social channels, depending on the open availability on the RISC-V social channels.
* Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”
