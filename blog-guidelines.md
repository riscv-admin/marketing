# RISC-V Blog Guidelines #

## Overview ##
The RISC-V blog program is designed to showcase RISC-V technical information and advancements, RISC-V adoption in products and the end-user community, reports from RISC-V events, and industry commentary and relevant insights about the developments happening in the RISC-V space.

The goal of the RISC-V blog is to provide one place for quality RISC-V content, hosted on the RISC-V website.

The blog serves as a channel for RISC-V members, Ambassadors, RISC-V Working Groups, Special Interest Groups (SIG), and Alliances to share content with the RISC-V community.

## Blog Audience and Topics ##
The RISC-V blog audience is a combination of business and technical audiences, students, and the community who want to learn about RISC-V. Content that teaches, talks about technical challenges and how they have been solved, industry commentary and relevant insights, and how-tos are valuable content for our audience.

Below are some broad suggested topics that it would be great to see members cover. Note that these content pieces are meant to carry informational/educational value, not product endorsements.
* Intro to RISC-V
* Security
* IP Cores
* Simulators
* Verification tools
* Trace/Debug tools
* IDEs
* Linux
* RTOS
* FPGA Implementations
* Machine Learning
* Architectural Innovations
* Open Source Hardware

Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the RISC-V community.

## Content Guidelines ##
* Posts from members must be vendor-neutral and not marketing content. Product endorsements are not permitted.
* All content should be universal to RISC-V topics and unrelated to specific products.
* The post may mention a vendor’s name as it relates to their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event or other indications of meaningful participation in the community.
* Posts should not feel like an advertisement for your services or company.
* Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is comparative and positive for the community.
* Members can add 1-2 sentences at the end of their blog with a link to an external site such as their website or a gated asset. We will review the statement, as we do for the content for the blog, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.
* We highly encourage providing an image with your blog to be placed as a featured image. Images in the blog are valuable for helping enhance the content in your blog. There are many places to get royalty free images such as Unsplash.
* Your post must be your content, but can be published elsewhere with a right to republish. All content should have an author along with their headshot and short bio. All images should be shared with proper image credits (name or description of image, creator/photographer).
* Announcements or press releases are not posted to the blog page. These are instead posted to [In the News](https://riscv.org/news/in-the-news/)

## Process ##
To submit a blog for consideration, email content@riscv.org with the blog idea or blog content. The RISC-V content team will review the content for applicability to the RISC-V blog. We will respond with a proposed date of publication or if it’s not suitable for the RISC-V blog, we will provide feedback and direction.

If you are submitting an article or presentation that already exists, please send it in its entirety with a note on the expressed permission from the owner of the content.

All contributed content is subject to revision and approval by RISC-V content team.

Once the content is approved, RISC-V Marketing will publish the blog on riscv.org.

## Promotion ##
Two types of promotion:
* Call to members for content: Call to members for content is done in the Marketing Committee meeting and with occasional emails to the marketing email list.
* Promotion of the blog content: Published blogs are promoted via the RISC-V social channels (Twitter and LinkedIn). We encourage you to amplify the social posts with your audience.
